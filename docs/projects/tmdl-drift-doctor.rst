=================

**A drift-detection and remediation suite for fleets of Power BI semantic
models, with a documentation set built to match its scope, not its
feature count.**

The problem it solves is one I know from the inside. When a company
delivers analytics as one semantic model per client, all derived from a
shared template, entropy is the default: the template improves, and a
dozen client models each drift a little, an edited measure here, a
missing column there, a table retired months ago still haunting three
tenants. tmdl-drift-doctor turns "are the clients up to date" from an
afternoon of eyeballing diffs into three commands: ``capture`` a
baseline of the template, ``detect`` typed drift findings per model, and
``remediate`` by cascading template truth back out, allowlist-gated,
dry-runnable, and recorded in an append-only audit ledger.

I built it as an open-source Python package (CLI, parser, safe
text-surgery engine, 60 tests over a fictional gym-chain fleet), and its
documentation is not an appendix to the tool. Before release the suite
was also exercised against a production-scale fleet, a 108-table,
614-measure template with three derived client models and roughly 780
findings, so the claims in the docs are validated, not merely tested.

The documentation
-----------------

The docs follow `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr>`_, but not to the
letter: a tutorial walks a sandbox fleet from first capture to first
cascade, one how-to guide covers the three tasks an operator actually
faces (onboarding a model, cascading a retirement, recovering from an
unwanted remediation), a second covers CI, and two reference pages
cover the CLI plus configuration, and the drift-kind catalog plus the
ledger format.

The design decisions live inside those reference pages instead of in a
separate explanation section, because each one earns its place next to
the command or config key it justifies rather than as a standalone
essay. The one I am proudest of: why nothing cascades unless an
allowlist names it, why deletions need a second flag on top of that,
why a stale baseline is refused rather than silently trusted, and the
guarded raw-text editing that exists because a naive version of it once
injected a property line into a bare multi-line DAX expression and broke
every affected measure across a production fleet in one pass. The
drift-kind catalog carries the same discipline down to the per-kind
level: every kind's table row gets a "do not cascade blindly when" note,
so the reference doubles as the judgment calls an operator needs before
running ``--sync``.

Writing that discipline out was not decoration; it was verification.
Stating plainly when a kind should not be auto-fixed forced design
decisions the code then had to honor: extras on shared tables became
advisory-only findings with no remediation path at all, and the
stale-baseline failure mode became a guard that refuses to run rather
than a warning. If the reasoning cannot be written cleanly, the behavior
is usually wrong.
